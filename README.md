# Improving performance of deep learning models for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation via attention mechanisms
This is the official implementation of "Improving performance of deep learning models for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation via attention mechanisms" paper

Out implemented network SPVCNN with Point Transformer in the voxel branch, achieves State Of the Art Results in Street3D dataset
